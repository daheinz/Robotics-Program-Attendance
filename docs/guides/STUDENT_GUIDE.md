## Your First Time

### Getting Your Account

When you join the team, a mentor or coach will:
1. Create your account in the system
2. Give you your **PIN** (4-6 digit number)
3. Show you your **name/alias** on the check-in screen

**Write down your PIN!** You'll need it every day.

### Finding Your Name

When you arrive at the check-in screen (kiosk):
- Your name appears in the list of users
- Names are sorted alphabetically
- You might see your full name or a nickname/alias
- If you can't find your name, ask a mentor

## Daily Check-Out

### When to Check Out
✅ **Check out when you leave** - Don't forget!  
✅ Check out even if you're leaving early  
✅ Check out even if practice is still ongoing  

**Important**: Forgetting to check out makes your attendance record incomplete!

### How to Check Out

**Step 1**: Find your name on the screen  
- Same process as check-in

**Step 2**: Click/tap your name  
- Your name will be highlighted

**Step 3**: Enter your PIN  
- Same PIN you used to check in

**Step 4**: Click "Check Out"  
- Button turns red/orange
- Reflection screen appears

**Step 5**: Write your reflection  
- Read the prompt (changes periodically)
- Type what you learned or accomplished today
- Examples:
  - "Learned how to wire a motor controller"
  - "Practiced driving and improved turning"
  - "Helped build the intake mechanism"
  - "Finished CAD design for arm assembly"
  
**Step 6**: Click "Submit" or "Check Out"  
- You'll see confirmation message
- Screen returns to main list

**Expected**: You see "Checked out successfully!" message with your reflection saved

**Reflection Tips**:
- Be specific (not just "worked on robot")
- Mention what you learned
- Include what you accomplished
- 1-3 sentences is perfect
- Helps mentors understand your progress

**Troubleshooting**:
- **Reflection required error**: You must type something before submitting
- **Not checked in error**: You need to check in first
- **Can't remember what I did**: Think about: What part did you work on? What new skill did you practice? Who did you help?

## Requesting Time Off

### How to Request an Absence

**You cannot record your own absences** - You must tell a mentor or coach.

**Methods**:
1. **Tell a mentor/coach in person** (best)
2. **Text/message your mentor or coach**
3. **Email your mentor or coach**

**Include This Information**:
- What date(s) you'll be absent
- Why you can't attend
  - Examples: Doctor appointment, family trip, school event, illness

**What Happens**:
1. Mentor/coach records your absence in the system
2. They mark it as "Approved" or "Unapproved"
3. Your absence shows on the Presence Board (green if approved)
4. You don't lose attendance credit for approved absences

**Important Notes**:
- Request absences in advance when possible
- Be honest about why you can't attend
- Emergency absences are okay - just let someone know ASAP
- Only mentors/coaches can see your absence reason (it's private)

### Checking If Your Absence Was Recorded

**Look at the Presence Board**:
- If you have a green section on your row = Approved absence
- If your row is empty = No absence recorded (or not approved)

**Ask a mentor/coach** if you're not sure

## Common Questions

### "What if I forget my PIN?"

**Solution**: Ask a mentor or coach  
- They can look it up in the system
- They can reset it to a new number
- Write it down somewhere safe!

### "What if I forget to check in?"

**It happens!**  
- Check in as soon as you remember
- Mentors can manually add your session later if needed
- Your hours still count if a mentor adds the session

### "What if I forget to check out?"

**This is a problem!**  
- Your session stays "open" forever
- System doesn't know when you left
- Mentors have to manually close it

**Prevention**:
- Set a reminder on your phone
- Ask someone to remind you
- Make it a habit before leaving

**If you forgot**:
- Tell a mentor the next day
- They can fix it by adding your check-out time

### "Can I check in someone else?"

**No - each person must use their own PIN**  
- This ensures accurate attendance
- Each person is responsible for their own check-in/out

### "What if I arrive late or leave early?"

**Still check in and out!**  
- Partial attendance is better than no record
- System tracks your actual time on-site
- Helps mentors understand your schedule

### "Can I see other students' attendance?"

**No - only your own**  
- Your dashboard shows only your records
- Presence Board shows everyone (but not specific hours)
- Only mentors/coaches see detailed reports

### "Why do I need to write a reflection?"

**Reflections help**:
- You remember what you learned
- Mentors understand your progress
- Team tracks skill development
- You can review your own learning over time

**Make them meaningful!** Mentors read these.

### "What if my name isn't on the list?"

**Possible reasons**:
- Account not created yet
- Account deactivated
- Using wrong name/alias

**Solution**: Ask a mentor  
- They'll check if you have an account
- They'll create one if needed
- They'll tell you your display name

### "Can I change my alias/nickname?"

**Yes - ask a mentor**  
- They can update your display name
- Helpful if you prefer a nickname
- Name still works the same way

### "What happens if I don't check in/out?"

**Consequences**:
- Your attendance hours aren't tracked
- Mentors don't know you were here
- Incomplete records make reports inaccurate
- May affect competition participation (team rules vary)

**Make it a habit!**
